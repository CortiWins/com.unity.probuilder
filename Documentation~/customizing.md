# Customize ProBuilder

You can customize ProBuilder and set preferences in the [ProBuilder Preferences](preferences.md) window. You can set the following preferences:Â 

| **Preference type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [Dimensions Overlay](preferences.md#dimover) | Customize which elements the Dimensions overlay uses. |
| [Experimental](preferences.md#experimental) | Toggle ProBuilder beta features. |
| [General](preferences.md#general) | A variety of settings, many of which control what information appears in the **Scene** view. For example, you can see the dimensions of your mesh, how many vertices, edges, and faces are in the scene and which ones are selected. |
| [Graphics](preferences.md#graphics) | Control the colors the Unity Editor uses when you edit. You can use the Unity color scheme, or disable the Use Unity Colors preference to set your own colors for the ProBuilder geometry elements. |
| [Mesh Editing](preferences.md#mesh-editing) | Change how you interact with meshes. |
| [Mesh Settings](preferences.md#mesh-settings) | Define defaults for ProBuilder meshes (such as default material, collider type, and shadows). |
| [Snap Settings](preferences.md#snapping) | Customize how snapping behaves with ProBuilder. |
| [UV Editor](preferences.md#uv-editor) | Change the size of the grid on the [UV Editor](uv-editor.md) window. |
| [Debug menu](menu.md#debug) | Control the level of logging ProBuilder uses (errors, warnings, debugs, basic, or a combination of these), and the output location. |
