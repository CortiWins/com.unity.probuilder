# New Shape and Edit Shape tools

To create a new shape:

1. Initiate the New Shape tool in one of the following ways:

    * In the **Tools** overlay, click the **New Shape** icon. A short click creates the selected shape; a long click opens a selection menu to choose a different shape.
    * In the main menu, go to **Tools** > **ProBuilder** > **Editors** > **New Shape**.
1. Click and drag in the **Scene** view to draw the shape in 2D, then extrude it.

To edit an existing shape:

1. Select the shape in the **Scene** view. The **Tools** overlay changes context to **ProBuilder** and displays the **Edit Shape** icon.
1. Click **Edit Shape** to open the **Shape Settings** window.<a name="Snapping"></a>

## Snap to grid

To draw an exact size and location, use the **Grid Snapping** option to guide your mouse along the grid as you draw. To enable grid snapping, do one of the following:

* Set constant grid snapping:
    1. In the **Tool Settings** overlay, set **Tool Handle Rotation** to **Global**. 
    1. In the **Grid and Snap** overlay, activate **Grid Snapping**.
* Hold **Ctrl** (macOS: **Cmd**) as you draw.

> **Tip:** To set the size of these increments, use the **Increment Snap** property in the [**Grid and Snap**](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/GridSnapping.html#grid-and-snap) overlay.

## Shape settings

Each shape has its own settings. To access the settings for a shape, select the shape in the **Scene** view and click **Edit Shape** in the **Tools** overlay to open the **Shape Settings** window. These settings are also available in the **Inspector** window.
