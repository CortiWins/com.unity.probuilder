# Editor windows

![Editor windows](images/pb_editors.png)

Editor windows provide [features](tool-panels.md) with extended functionality. For example, the UV Editor window (in the example image above) allows you to perform advanced texture manipulations, including texture mapping, UV unwrapping, and tiling.

To access these windows, use the [ProBbuilder menu](menu.md) or [keyboard shortcuts](hotkeys.md).
